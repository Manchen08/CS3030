--------------------
Commands Introducted
--------------------
man - display online manual pages, try 'man ls' or 'man man'
ls - list directory contents
cat - concatenate files and print to standard output
mkdir - make directories
cd - change directoris
cp - copy files and directories
less - file perusal, allows backwards and forwards viewing
echo - display a line of text

---------------------
Environment Variables
---------------------
The contents of a bash environment variable can be printed out using the
echo command, for example:
Hello!

echo $HOME

Another shortcut for $HOME is ~, or the tilde.

$PATH is a very important variable that contains a list of paths to various
  directories in the filesystem. Each of these directories contain executible
  programs. Having the directory in your $PATH variable allows you to simply
  type the command, leaving off the full path.

~/.bashrc is a file located in your home directory. It contains commands
  that are ran when you log in to Linux. This is where you can customize your
  shell, to include making modifications to $PATH.

Since .bashrc begins with a . (period), it is normally hidden. Use the -a 
  switch on ls to view all files, including the hidden ones, for example:

ls -la ~

------------------------------
File and Directory Permissions
------------------------------
Each file and directory has three user based permission groups:
 - owner : The Owner permissions apply only to the owner user.
 - group : The Group permissions apply to all users thare are in the group.
 - all users : The All Users permissions apply to all other users on the
               system.

There are three types of permissions:
r = Read    : Permission to VIEW a file 
w = Write   : Permission to ALTER a file
x = eXecute : Permission to RUN a file

Each of the three groups can have any combination of the three types
of permissions.

The command ls -l will display the file permissons. For example:
-rw-r--r--. 1 ibm9999 student 1016 Jul 18 22:20 README
  ^  ^  ^
  |  |  |___ Everyone
  |  |______ Group
  |_________ Owner

In the above example, the user ibm9999 is the owner and has permission
  to read and write the README file. The users in group student have 
  permission to read the file, and everyone else on the system has
  permission to read the file.
